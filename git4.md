# Main case

Alcohol fatty liver: AST > ALT because you toa**st**

## Trigger 1

Priority in assessing him:

-  Primary survey: DRSABCD: mainly circulation => where is the bleeding
-  Gain access for fluid recovery
-  Vitals

Haemorrhage in the upper GI

-  Ulcer: duodenal/peptic
-  Oesophageal varices
-  Mallory Weis tear: from the forceful vomiting
-  Neoplasia
-  Angiodysplasia
-  Nose bleed: haemoptysis
-  Goodpastures
-  Oesophagitis/gastritis
-  Trauma
-  Coagulopathy
-  Drugs/iatrogenic

Quick Ex:

-  Vitals again
-  CVS
-  Resp
-  GIT

Hx:

-  What colour, how much, happened before, vomiting out any clots: lot of blood sitting around somewhere, pain
-  How long feeling tired, appetite changes, associated symptoms, abnormal stools
-  Drug alcohol use

Loss of blood => hypotensive => detected by aortic arch/other => sympathetic stimulation => sweating + emesis (muscarinic receptor even though sympathetic)

## Trigger 2

Hypovolaemia => almost into shock

Increased abdo girth: fat, fluid, flatus, faeces, foetus, filthy big tumour

Risk factors

-  CVS: this guy has everything
-  Liver: alcohol => cirrhosis => portal hypertension + coagulopathy
-  GIT: peptic ulcer => bleeding

Before talking to partner need the pt consent, be open with both of them. Notes: "pt says this; wife says this"

Healthy drinking: no more than 2 a day, no more than 4 in one sitting

Effects of alcohol:

-  Acute: flushing, feel good, poisoning, fatty liver/alcohol hepatitis, cardiomyopathy, injury, aspiration, losing license/job
-  Chronic: cirrhosis => portal hypertension => splenomegaly, neurological defects, malnutrition, cancer

Pathogenesis

Alcohol is readily absorbed by the stomach, and in the liver is converted to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADh) by the removal of two hydrogens, which enter a cascade. 
Acetaldehyde is converted ultimately to acetate and metabolised as a potent source of calories. 
Acetaldehyde is a cell poison and causes inflammatory changes in the liver. 
in addition, the hydrogen from ADh and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase promotes the production of fatty acids and thus the triglycerides of fatty liver and the elevated serum lipoprotein. 
Also, the excess lactate in the liver impairs urate excretion and promotes the production of gout.

Particular Hx for possible chronic disease

-  Sexual Hx
-  Travel Hx: any dental work, tattoos (whilst there)

Peripheral stigmata of liver disease: check Talleys

## Trigger 3

Got 2 of the stigmata suggestive of liver cirrhosis

Multiple processes causing cirrhosis: alcohol not the only thing, maybe virus, T2D, $\alpha-1$-antitrypsin disease, haematomachrosis

Liver disease => bleeding:

-  Portal hypertension => varices
-  Coagulopathy: liver not producing clotting factors
-  Cancer => haemorrhage
-  Portal hypertension => thrombocytopaenia ($\Downarrow$ platelets)

Blood transfusion: if he is anaemic since he's not actively bleeding

Ix:

-  Bloods: FBC, ELFT, serology for viral hepatitis, coag panel
-  Liver ultrasound
-  Scope

## Trigger 4

Haematemsis/cirrhosis => higher risk of infn => start on antibiotics empirically

Varices important: pathways + clinical signs

IgG: either previous infn/vaccination

## Trigger 5

Genotype determines specific treatment

HCV: blood (transfusion), sex, IV drug access, tattoos when they were much younger; majority are stable

Echogenic liver: steatosis, but not fibrosis

## Trigger 6

When you do extra tests: need to check for consent. E.g. gonna do Hep tests, if they come back positive then it is notifiable.

Principles of Mx: stop drinking, check vaccinations, think of drugs, cancer screening

## Trigger 7

Liver biopsy now is prognostic

$\beta$-blocker can help reduce portal hypertension

# Short case 1

## Trigger 1

Further Hx: 

-  Tiredness: changed anything, has anything changed recently, sleep, get context on his tiredness
-  Any other symptoms
    -  Unexplained weight loss, nausea, vomiting, bruising bleeding
-  When did you last feel well?
-  How is he coping with his brothers death?
-  Does wife complain of you sleeping? (OSA)
-  Fam Hx/PMHx
-  Drugs: alcohol, illicit
-  Diet

Risk factors for liver cancer:

-  Alcohol
-  Viral infn/Hepatitis/cirrhosis
-  IV drug use
-  Fam Hx
-  Obesity
-  Haematomachrosis
-  Male gender
-  Aflatoxins, arsenic, anabolic steroids
-  Smoking

Tiredness

-  Depression, sleep deprivation/disturbance, lifestyle, giving up caffeine, change in diet, work/stress
-  Cancer, hypothyroidism, anaemia, coeliacs, OSA, diabetes, shift worker disorder, chronic illness

## Trigger 2

DDx:

-  Hep C less likely as it is mostly from IV drug use
-  Hep B: SEA with strong vertical transmission: risk factors = {blood transfusion, iv drug use, sex, living with an infn}

Ex: 

-  General inspection: pallor
-  Vitals
-  CVS Ex: murmurs because aortic stenosis/regurg can lead to 
-  GIT: clubbing, leukoplakia, chronic liver disease, organomegaly
-  Resp: breathing issues => apnoea, SOB

## Trigger 3

Ix:

-  Bloods: FBC (Hb; WCC; platelets), ELFT, thyroid function test (even though male and less likely), ESR/CRP (if something suggested inflamm cause; not in this pt)
-  Hep serology: because he has risk factors for Hep B

## Trigger 4

Hep serology:

-  Anti HBs: resolved or vaccinated
-  HBV DNA: shows if pt is infective 
-  HBsAg: current HB infn
-  Anti HBc IgG:

Hep B transmitted: vertically, blood, sex, vaginal secretions, organ transplantation


# Short case 2

Learn the heps

## Trigger 1

Epigastric: foregut + inferior MI

Ix:

-  Bloods: FBC, ELFT
-  USS
-  Pregnancy test

## Trigger 2

Risk factors:

-  Fat
-  Female
-  Fair
-  Fourty
-  Fertile
-  Rapid weight loss
-  Liver diseases
-  Oral contraceptive pill + pregnancy
-  Fam Hx
-  Diabetes

Complications of cholelithiasis (usually asymptomatic):

-  Pain
-  Acute cholecystitis: obstruction => inflamm => pain
    -  Gallstone pancreatitis
-  Ascending cholangitis

Mx:

-  Cholecystectomy
-  Watch and wait: antibiotics
-  Lithotripsy: smaller


## Trigger 3

Pain: acute pancreatitis (fatal in 10% of cases due to SIRS)

Ix:

-  Bloods: FBC, ELFT, 
-  ECG
-  CXR/AbdoXR
