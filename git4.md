# Main case

## Trigger 1

Priority in assessing him:

-  Primary survey: DRSABCD: mainly circulation => where is the bleeding
-  Gain access for fluid recovery
-  Vitals

Haemorrhage in the upper GI

-  Ulcer: duodenal/peptic
-  Oesophageal varices
-  Mallory Weis tear: from the forceful vomiting
-  Neoplasia
-  Angiodysplasia
-  Nose bleed: haemoptysis
-  Goodpastures
-  Oesophagitis/gastritis
-  Trauma
-  Coagulopathy
-  Drugs/iatrogenic

Quick Ex:

-  Vitals again
-  CVS
-  Resp
-  GIT

Hx:

-  What colour, how much, happened before, vomiting out any clots: lot of blood sitting around somewhere, pain
-  How long feeling tired, appetite changes, associated symptoms, abnormal stools
-  Drug alcohol use

Loss of blood => hypotensive => detected by aortic arch/other => sympathetic stimulation => sweating + emesis (muscarinic receptor even though sympathetic)

## Trigger 2

Hypovolaemia => almost into shock

Increased abdo girth: fat, fluid, flatus, faeces, foetus, filthy big tumour

Risk factors

-  CVS: this guy has everything
-  Liver: alcohol => cirrhosis => portal hypertension + coagulopathy
-  GIT: peptic ulcer => bleeding

Before talking to partner need the pt consent, be open with both of them. Notes: "pt says this; wife says this"

Healthy drinking: no more than 2 a day, no more than 4 in one sitting

Effects of alcohol:

-  Acute: flushing, feel good, poisoning, fatty liver/alcohol hepatitis, cardiomyopathy, injury, aspiration, losing license/job
-  Chronic: cirrhosis => portal hypertension => splenomegaly, neurological defects, malnutrition, cancer

Pathogenesis

Alcohol is readily absorbed by the stomach, and in the liver is converted to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADh) by the removal of two hydrogens, which enter a cascade. 
Acetaldehyde is converted ultimately to acetate and metabolised as a potent source of calories. 
Acetaldehyde is a cell poison and causes inflammatory changes in the liver. 
in addition, the hydrogen from ADh and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase promotes the production of fatty acids and thus the triglycerides of fatty liver and the elevated serum lipoprotein. 
Also, the excess lactate in the liver impairs urate excretion and promotes the production of gout.

Particular Hx for possible chronic disease

-  Sexual Hx
-  Travel Hx: any dental work, tattoos (whilst there)

Peripheral stigmata of liver disease: check Talleys

## Trigger 3

Got 2 of the stigmata suggestive of liver cirrhosis

Multiple processes causing cirrhosis: alcohol not the only thing, maybe virus, T2D, $\alpha-1$-antitrypsin disease, haematomachrosis

Liver disease => bleeding:

-  Portal hypertension => varices
-  Coagulopathy: liver not producing clotting factors
-  Cancer => haemorrhage
-  Portal hypertension => thrombocytopaenia ($\Downarrow$ platelets)

Blood transfusion: if he is anaemic since he's not actively bleeding

Ix:

-  Bloods: FBC, ELFT, serology for viral hepatitis, coag panel
-  Liver ultrasound
-  Scope

## Trigger 4

Haematemsis/cirrhosis => higher risk of infn => start on antibiotics empirically

Varices important: pathways + clinical signs

IgG: either previous infn/vaccination

## Trigger 5

Genotype determines specific treatment

HCV: blood (transfusion), sex, IV drug access, tattoos when they were much younger; majority are stable

Echogenic liver: steatosis, but not fibrosis

## Trigger 6

When you do extra tests: need to check for consent. E.g. gonna do Hep tests, if they come back positive then it is notifiable.

Principles of Mx: stop drinking, check vaccinations, think of drugs, cancer screening

## Trigger 7

Liver biopsy now is prognostic

$\beta$-blocker can help reduce portal hypertension

# Short case 1

# Short case 2
