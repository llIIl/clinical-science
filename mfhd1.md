Tl;dr most common: PALM-COEIN (polyp, adenomyosis, leiomyoma, malignancy and hyperplasia, coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial, iatrogenic, and not yet classified)

-  Structural: uterine leiomyomas, endometrial polyps, adenomyosis, caesarean scar defect, enhanced myometrial vascularity (AV malformation)
-  Ovalutary dysfn
-  Bleeding disorders
-  Iatrogenic: anticoagulants, hormonal contraceptives,..
-  Neoplasia: endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma, uterine sarcoma
-  Infn and inflamm: endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease
-  Disorders of local endometrial haemostasis
-  Ectopic pregnancy usually ruptures after 8 weeks

MSAC recommended:

-  New test every 5 years, as opposed to pap test which was every 2 years for people $35\leq\text{age}\leq74$
-  an HPV test with partial genotyping should be undertaken every five years
-  cervical screening should commence at 25 years of age
-  people should have an exit test between 70 and 74 years of age
-  people with symptoms (including pain or bleeding) can have a cervical test at any age

Terminology

-  AUB: menstrual bleeding of abnormal quantity, duration, or schedule
-  Heavy menstrual bleeding: regular bleeding that is abnormally heavy or prolonged referring only to cyclic (ovulatory) menses. Can't maintain usual activities due to blood loss and cramping. Symptoms include: needing double sanitary protection for menstrual flow, waking during the night, >1 week, clots larger than a quarter
-  Old: menorrhagia is less precise as it does not differentiate between volume and duration of bleeding or between cyclic and anovulatory bleeding
-  Intermenstrual bleeding (metrorrhagia): intermenstrual uterine bleeding
-  Irregular bleeding (ovulatory dysfn): most commonly associated with ovulatory dysfn (AUB-O). characterized by phases of no bleeding that may last for two or more months and other phases with either spotting or episodes of heavy bleeding
-  Oligomenorrhoea: menstrual periods occuring at $\text{intervals}>35\text{days}$
-  Amenorrhoea – Amenorrhea refers to absence of bleeding for at least three usual cycle lengths

The average age of menopause is 51 years [8]. Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. This is typically preceded by several years of irregular uterine bleeding and menopausal symptoms (eg, hot flushes)

{Terminology](http://sinoemedicalassociation.org/AP2/OBGYNTERMINOLOGYDEFINITION.pdf)

-  GPA = {gravida (number of pregnancies), para (number of births of viable offspring), ab abortus (abortions)}
-  TPAL = {term births, preterm births ($<$37 weeks gestation), abortions, living children}


Hx:

-  Menstrual Hx: frequency, regularity, volume, duration
-  Sexual Hx: info about pregnancy risk and STIs
-  Obstetric/gynae Hx: caesarean, myomectomy raises possibility of leiomyofibroma
-  Contraceptive Hx
-  Risk factors for endometrial cancer
-  Bleeding disorders, thyroid, coeliacs
-  Medications



## Trigger 2

Terminology

-  Dysmenorrhoea: painful periods
-  Dyspareunia: painful sexual intercourse

Ex:

-  General appearance: anaemic pallor would present in the conjunctiva first, pbesity => $\Uparrow$ oestrogen due to adipose tissue
-  Thyroid
-  Pelvic examination: potential sites of bleeding, masses, size and contour of the uterus (pregnancy, leiomyomas, malignancy), current bleeding, adnexal mass or tenderness
-  Abdo examination



## Trigger 3

Adenomyosis refers to a disorder in which endometrial glands and stroma are present within the uterine musculature (uterine adenomyomatosis). The ectopic endometrial tissue appears to induce hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the surrounding myometrium, which results in a diffusely enlarged uterus (often termed "globular" enlargement) analogous to the concentric enlargement of the pregnant uterus.

Ix:

-  Pregnancy test: urine hCG is quick
-  Bloods: FBC (anaemic, coagulopathy?, abN WCC in chronic endometritis), TSH (oligmenorrhoea and amenorrhoea)
-  Cervical screening test: neoplasia => cervical bleeding
-  Endometrial sampling: indicated 45-menopause ovulatory and any AUB; <45  if AUB present in historyof unopposed oestrogen exposure
-  Pelvic ultrasound



## Trigger 4

Positioning of uterus

-  Anteversion: long axis of uterus makes a right angle with the longitudinal axis of the vagina
-  Anteflexed: the longitudinal axis of the body makes an angle 170 with longitudinal axis of the cervix
-  b excessive anteversion; c retroverted; d retroverted and retroflexed

DDx focal thickening endometrium:

-  Endometrial carcinoma, hyperplasia (usually diffuse), polyp
-  Tamoxifen related endometrial change
-  HRT
-  Endometritis
-  Adhesions

## Trigger 5

Pipelle introduced in the 80s made of flexibly polyporpylene sheath, piston slides within the sheath allowing negative pressure to be applied and obtain sample. 
There was a higher complication rate in the D+C group but the failure rate was higher in the endometrial pipelle biopsy group
Pipelle biopsy and D&C showed almost equal success rate in the diagnosis of endometrial pathologies.
Both biopsy methods are not perfect, but pipelle biopsy is a cheaper and easy technique compared with D&C [source](https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/article/10.1007/s00404-012-2438-8)

World Health Organization classification — The 2015 WHO endometrial hyperplasia classification system has only two categories

-  Hyperplasia without atypia (non-neoplastic)
-  Atypical hyperplasia (endometrial intraepithelial neoplasm)

Nuclear atypia – Nuclear atypia is the presence of nuclear enlargement; the chromatin may be either evenly dispersed or clumped, and/or prominent nucleoli may be present

Pathophysiology of endometrial hyperplasia

Endometrial hyperplasia results from continuous estrogen stimulation that is unopposed by progesterone. This can be due to endogenous estrogen or exogenous estrogenic sources. The exact mechanism of estrogen's role in the transformation of normal endometrium to hyperplasia and cancer is unknown. Genetic alterations are known to be associated with hyperplasia and type I endometrial cancers. Lesions with hyperplasia are associated with microsatellite instability and defects in DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) associated with the Lynch Syndrome.  PTEN tumor suppressor gene mutations have also been found in 55% of hyperplasia cases and 83% of hyperplasia cases once it has progressed to endometrial cancer. 

# Short case 1

# Short case 2

DRE because you can palpate parts of the uterus. Adds extra information on top of bimanual examination
