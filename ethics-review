# Week 2

Normative is what we have mainly being studying.

Virtue ethics: aristotle sees each virtue lying between excess and deficiency. 3 conditions present in the soul. Virtues **are** habits. 2 types of virtues(learn the table in the slides)

-  Moral: habitual dispositions
-  Intellectual: science, arts

Does not exclude emotions from moral reasoning that consequentialism and deontology do. Centreed around practical wisdom (phronesis). Aim is to become good at thinking about what a good person would due, but it is cyclic-y. I.e. "yeah I'll be good" => do good behaviour => keep doing it, but do not know what good is. 

More virtue ethics: learn those buzzwords (first 6 are *most important*)
