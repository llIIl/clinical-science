Private GP healthcare providers located separately > fragmentation

ACCHS also offer home consultations => better coverage

Accreditation affects quality of care access and health

# 2

GPs have lots of overseas to combat workforce shortage => may not have cultural understanding. ACCHSs employ mainly abos => offer culturally appropriate care

ACCHSs staff dynamic often taking time off for additional training or educational opportunities

Whilst there are workforce shortages in both, initiatives increasing number of places

# 3

ACCHSs also collect info from family members who are often seen in consultation

# 4

ACCHSs offer medication in them; GPs don't => can affect adherence

Closing the Gap PBS measure reduces the cost of PBS medicines for ATSI. Remaining co-payment is often then covered by ACCHSs so medications are free of charge => improve ocmpliance by reducing financial disincentives

ACCHSs have access to other aspects of funding such as through Indigenous Australians' Health Programme which provides abos with better healthcare through primary health carte. Also funding through primary health networks, charitable donations, and not for profits. 

Both: MBS Patient incentives program (PIP), ACCHSs also have access to short term projhect funding government grants. Unreliable funding as often pilot programs and short term.

Government turn-overs cast insecurity to both.

Governance completely differenet. GP are self managed, clinical governance leaders make decisions regard management of the practice. Has a hierarchical structure where leadership board is run by doctors and other health professionals. ACCHSs are established  organised governed by Abo community board that is elected controlling health care delivery. Helps develop trust through self-determination.

Policies implemnted differently. ACCHS staff are registered and answerable to the Gov, also conform to standards by abos community. Ensures that the Patients who use servcices have a say => rapid responses -> culturall approrpriate.

Difference in aims: ACCHSs healthcare equity and community empowerment, GPs eradicate disease through medical interventions.
