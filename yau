 # Friend got hacked then got perma banned

Hey guys, a really good friend of mine (summoner name: YAU) recently got hacked on OCE league. The hacker then proceeded to script and played about 10 games from 7-18 May after which YAU changed his password. However he forgot to submit a ticket to riot and as such, ended up getting perma'd for scripting. 

He then sent a ticket to Riot OCE, and in their response, he got flipped off. I've copied their original response below.

> Hello YAU,

>  Your account has been permanently suspended following the use of scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs in League of Legends. 
>  In such cases, the accounts that are caught using hacks to gain an unfair competitive advantage are subject to permanent suspension. We work hard to preserve a fair and competitive environment in League of Legends. Regardless of intent, use of unauthorized third-party programs is explicitly against the Terms of Use, which can be found here:

>  OCE: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse

>  **You have to keep in mind that you are responsible for all activity on your account. You should've contacted us right away after finding signs of suspicious activity on your account.**

>  We won't be able to go into the specifics of an account's exploit abuse, as divulging this information could compromise future investigations. 
>  Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

So he is basically being banned because he is **responsible for the hackers activity** on his account. I'm not going to say YAU is faultless because he definitely should have sent in a ticket, but how would he know that the hacker ended up scripting? I think that it is extremely unfair as he has played for ages, sunk hours and hours of time into his account, has never been a toxic person, or been banned. We've both played since preseason 2 so suffice to say, losing an account with so much time and money invested into it is non-trivial and fairly disheartening. 

He then appealed their response only to be hit with this wonderful, eloquent, and beautiful paragraph.

> I am really sorry for the situation, but the suspension cannot be lifted under any circumstance. The decision is final and cannot be contested.

So I've written this post to see if any of you guys have been in this situation and how did you get it resolved?

Note: some proof that he didn't suddenly decide to start scripting after playing league for >5 years (from his support ticket). This is also only a single paragraph out of a 2 page word doc which contains a bit more info. 

> I believe the first occurrence of someone else playing on my account was the 7th of May 2017, where Brand support was played in a solo-queue ranked game. There are a few ways I can justify why and how this wasn’t me, which may be aided by any information that you may be able to access, particularly: extended match history (2011-2017) and location or IP address of this particular login. Firstly, I very much dislike playing support mages, as I much prefer supports with more utility (Thresh is my favourite). Secondly, and in the same vein, I almost always run Exhaust on support rather than Ignite, bar from probably a few Zyra games last year where I didn’t play very well. Thirdly, I believe I have purchased ‘Eye of the Watchers’ once in my entire career – I don’t think it is a good item, as I prefer the utility provided by Frost Queen’s Claim. Fourthly, this is a solo-queue game! I didn’t want to play my placements for solo queue until I had some time to practice first, that is, after semester ended. Lastly – who on earth still has the yellow trinket at 37 minutes into the game as a support? While there are some cases of me forgetting to upgrade to a blue trinket while playing ADC, I challenge you to find a match where I was supporting and did not change to a red (sweeping) trinket in a game that long.

**Tl;dr: Friend got hacked. Hacker scripted. Friend got banned. Told to fuck off.**
