# Readme

### Purpose

This is just a repo for my notes.

### What are these notes for?

This repo contains notes from the clinical science courses (MEDI7111,...) taught to MD students at the University of Queensland. These focus on different systems as should be fairly obvious from the naming of files.

Feel free to peruse these at your leisure, however there will be some idiosyncrasies as well as weird shorthand. Furthermore they will contain a YAML header as I use `knitr` (from R) to output these notes for reading on kindle as well as general cleanliness.
