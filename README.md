# Readme

### Purpose

Not much going on here, just my repo for notes.

### What do these contain?

Contains notes from the course MEDI7111. This is the main science course taught to MD students at the University of Queensland. It is a first year first semester course with emphasis on different body systems.

Feel free to peruse these at your leisure, however there will be some idiosyncrasies as well as weird shorthand. Furthermore they will contain a YAML header as I use `knitr` (from R) to output these notes for reading on kindle as well as general cleanliness.
