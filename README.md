# Readme

### Purpose

This is just a repo for my notes.

### What are these notes for?

This repo contains notes from the clinical science courses (MEDI7111, MEDI7112,...) taught to MD students at the University of Queensland. Each file represents an individual week, which has its focus on different systems (as should be fairly obvious from the naming).

Feel free to peruse these at your leisure, however there will be some idiosyncrasies as well as weird shorthand. Furthermore they will contain a YAML header as I use `knitr` (from R) to output these notes for reading on kindle as well as general cleanliness.

### How to use this?

You can either just read these off here, because github outputs stuff in markdown syntax really well.

Otherwise you can view it in the intended way by outputting it with `R` or `RStudio`. You will require a LaTeX engine such as `texlive`.

If you have bash, then `bash doc-render.sh` outputs the `.rmd` file without having to load `R`.
