# Main case

## Trigger 1

DDx:

-  Pencil cells suggestive of iron deficiency
-  Greek: $\beta$-thalassaemia risk 

Pt has anaemia, have to ask about symptoms of it: fatigue, bleeding, pallor, SOB

Femtoliter is the unit for MCV

Signs of anaemia: 

-  Pallor: less RBC
-  Jaundice: breakdown of bilirubin
-  Splenomegaly: extravascular haemolysis, macrophages in spleen eat up misshapen RBCs
-  Fatigue
-  Tachycardia but may not get change in BP due to decrease in viscosity
-  Flow murmurs
-  Severe: cardiopulmonary symptoms such as increased resp rate

## Trigger 2

If folate + Fe deficient, normocytic cells that should be larger because folate is implicated in DNA synthesis so it happens first in the pathway

Iron studies:

Low Fe => $\Downarrow$ Ferritin => $\Uparrow$ Transferrin

## Trigger 4

Alternative treatments

-  IV iron: will increase haematocrit => increases thromboembolic risk which is already high in pregnancy
-  Gauge likelihood of eating meat
