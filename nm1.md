# Main case

## Trigger 1

> 46F, obese

DDx:

-  CVS: heart failure, HTN, atherosclerosis, arrhythmias (AF), AAA, venous thrombosis
-  Resp: OSA, V/Q mismatch, bronchospasm
-  MSK: arthritis, fractures, gout
-  GIT: Ca, hernias, haemorrhoids, gallstones, GORD, non-alcoholic fatty liver, oesophagitis, hernias
-  Repro: infertility, gestational diabetes, sexual arousal issues, polycystic ovarian syndrome
-  Renal: CKD, diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive
-  Infn: decreased immune system, increased skin infn, pressure sores, influenza, candidiasis, stretch marks
-  Metabolic: diabetes, metabolic syndrome

Parameters for regular checkup; specifics depends on what they are complaining about

-  Ex:
    -  Vitals: BP, BMI
    -  Waist circumference
-  Ix:
    -  Blood: cholesterol

BMI: not too gucci for Asians, doesn't apply to children, bodybuilders:

-  [25, 30): overweight
-  [30, $\infty$): obese

## Trigger 2

Insert curtis image

T2D:

-  $\beta$-cells: make insulin
-  Insulin resistance
-  $\beta$-cells hypertrophy, hyperplasia => decompensate and hypotryphy
-  Want people to change diet, exercise, lose weight

Obesity: $\Uparrow$ serum triglycerides => $\Uparrow$ intracellular triglycerides => inhibit insulin signalling => acquired insulin resistance. Adipose tissues => secrete adipokines => IL-1$\beta$ 

HbA1c: percentage of glycated RBC, gives measure of blood glucose over longer time

## Trigger 3

Obesity: SUFE is more likely

Ask pt: "what do *you* like doing?", "what are you capable of doing?"

## Trigger 4

Complications of T2D:

Curtis image

Metformin:

-  $\Downarrow$liver gluconeogenesis
-  $\Downarrow$intestinal glucose absorption
-  $\Uparrow$peripheral glucose uptake

## Trigger 5

Regulation of hunger: flowchart from Curtis

T2D: AUSDRISK questionnaire provides risk of developing diabetes, repeat every 3 years + fasting glucose xor HbA1c

## Trigger 6

Metabolic syndrome = $5\times\text{risk of T2D}$

# Short case 1

# Short case 2
