# Random notes

Chvostek sign: 2cm anterior to earlobe is facial N => tap it => ipsilateral contractions => indicates hypocalcaemia

Trosseau sign is the other one that you should read up as it has much higher sensitivity

# POW: Thyroid gland

PC: solitary thyroid nodule (lump in the neck): can be neoplastic or non-neoplastic. Important DDx are mets, lymph node, parathyroid gland

Ix: thyroid fn test, ultrasound, radioactive iodine scan, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)

Histo: 
-  Grave's disease - The follicular epithelial cells are plumper and taller. There is marked depletion of colloid within most follicles. Vessels are prominent within the gland, reflecting increased metabolic activity of the organ.

# Main case

DDx:

-  Phaeochromocytoma
-  Anxiety disorder
-  Hyperinsulin (insulinoma for example)
-  Hyperthyroid
-  Substance abuse
-  Primary insomnia
-  Iatrogenic
-  Drugs: stimulant or withdrawal
-  Severe heart failure

Hx:

-  Whats your mood like, and have you lost interest in any hobbies? (screens for depression)
-  Episodic symptoms: PCC along with headaches, abdo/flank pain, maybe obstruction

Eye presentation

-  Exopthalmos: T cells sensitive to light so travel there => cytokines => hyalonic acid => in the extraocular muscles
-  Levator palpabrae superioris: eyelids retracted due to sympathetic stimulation (which retracts the levator)
-  She has a squint possibly due to eye bulging

Ex:

-  Proximal muscle weakness: should affect big muscle groups first
-  Conjunctival injection is extra blood flow
-  Visual acuity: 6/6 reassuring as not enough proptosis to affect optic nerve


IMSLOW: inferior rectus > med rec > sup rec > lat rec > obliques (muscles affected by graves)

Goitre: (not in australia) iodine deficiency > multinodular goitre > cancer

-  Cancer: TSH stimulates thyroid hyperplasia and hypertrophy > euthyroid reached > smooth goitre starts atrophying and fibrosis > multinodular
-  Leads to pembertons sign as arms are raised

Ix:

-  Bloods: FBC, Thyroid fn test
-  ECG: usually consider in Ex in case tachy is just sinus rhythm
-  Radioactive scan indicated if suspecting Ca

Mx:

-  Thyroid: carbimazole/pre
-  Goitre: leave it alone
-  Eyes: symptomatic relief with eye drops
-  I-131 higher risk of cancer and maybe need thyroid replacement therapy


Hyper/hypo-thyroidism is high yield
