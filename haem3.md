# Main case

## Trigger 1

Bleeding:

-  Vessel wall weakness
-  Platelet issue
-  Coagulation cascade issue

## Trigger 2

Pneumonia in alcoholic: aspiration

Thiamine is vit B1 because alcoholics get wernicke-korsakoff syndrome


If jaundiced/flapping tremmor => must MMSE

Gums should be bad in alcoholism



# Short case 1

See my godly presentation

# Short case 2

## Trigger 1

Menorrhagia: most common for 12-14 

-  Clotting
-  hypothalamic immaturity
-  psychogenic


Bleeding general questions: 4Ws

-  Who: age, sex, race, family Hx
-  When: onset (post trauma/surgery/dental/circumcision/pregnancy/...), duration
-  Where: skin, mucosa, joints, muscles
-  What: description of the bleed

Primary menorrhagia because it happened straight from the beginning: more likely to be problem with blood


Ix:

-  FBC+ smear
-  Coag panel
-  PFA (platelet function analysis): can use it if patient is using aspirin

## Trigger 2

In menorrhagia, it is very common to have a bleeding disorder

Medications causing increased bleeding: aspirin, warfarin, $\beta$-lactams, many herbal medications

PFA:

-  If both ADP and adrenaline increase then it is a platelet/vWF disorder
-  If only adrenaline increases then it is ADP

Von Willebrand activity: if blood type O then the percentage will be higher, range changes based on ABO blood type. Have to also order blood typing

Desmopressin increases release of vWF from endothelial cells (?) so it will be useful in vWD I (quantitative), probably not useful in vWD II (qualitative) and vWD III (severe quantitative + qualitative)
