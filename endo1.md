FLAT-PEG: 

GFR


# Main case

-  Optic neuritis: pain on moving eye around
-  Macular degeneration
-  Pituitary tumour can be hypo/hyper: ask grouped questions relating to hyper (anxiety, trembles, weight loss) OR hypo (dry skin, constipation)
    -  Secreting GH: shoe size increased? rings don't fit anymore
-  Intracranial lesion: headache waking him up at night
-  Stroke/TIA in ACA or PCA: ask about chest pain, risk factors for vascular disease such as arrhythmias, parasthesia or muscle weakness
-  DVT will not cause stroke unless he has congenital defect as it will go to long
-  Drugs, insomnia
-  Seizure
-  Diabetic retinopathy would present after 5-10 years: polyuria polydipsia
-  Mental health: depression, anxiety


Trigger 2

Adenoma in pituitary: sevreting/nonsecreting, Prl is the most common => decrease in other hormones due to mass effect and decreased sex hormone due to prolactin inhib effect

Or it could be stalk compression: everything decreases except for Prl, but has less prl than the prl adenoma

Presenting: Name A S presenting with likely pituitary Ca presented with bitemporal hemianopia a day after a MVA where he complained he didnt see anything. On Hx and Ex he has symptoms of low TSH (...), low ACTH(...),...

Snail trail is good place to look at for hair distn in men

Hypothyroidism: tendon reflex relaxation gets prolonged, e.g. achilles => foot goes up => slowly goes down

Trigger 3 or 4

of pituitary adenomas

-  40% prolactinoma
-  33% non functioning (secretory)
-  15% gh
-  10% acth
-  2% rest

Mx: give dopamine agonist (cabergoline; first line for prolactinoma only), replace cortisol, give thyroxine to make him feel better


# Short case 1

Infertility: >1year of trying

DDx:

-  Polycystic ovarian syndrome: before pill, menorrhagia, pain when cysts burst, fam Hx
-  Hyperthyroidism
-  Bullemia
-  Cushings: any steroids (iatrogenic)? headaches, visual disturbances (tumour in pituitary), delayed wound healing?
-  Medications: psychotropic agents, anti-seizures phenytoin
-  Liver/kidney => ascites which is mistaken as fat

Cushings: cortisol => androgen produnction

Asking about cough as SCLC can paraneoplastic 

Ix:

-  ELFT+creatinine (creatinine also gives EGFR)
-  Cortisol+ACTH, pituitary hormones, progesterone/testosterone
-  TSH for thyroid
-  dexamethasone test could be done after

Dexamethasone suppression test: exogenous test that has high affinity to glucocorticoid receptors => negative feedback => cortisol should go down.

A low dose of dexamethasone suppresses cortisol in individuals with no pathology in endogenous cortisol production. A high dose of dexamethasone exerts negative feedback on pituitary ACTH-producing cells and adrenal (they should already have low ACTH; uptodate), but not on ectopic ACTH-producing cells

Cortisol effects = A BIG FIB

-  **A**ppetite
-  **b**lood pressure
-  **i**ncreased **g**luconeogenesis
-  decreased **f**ibroblastic, **i**mmune/**i**nflammation, **b**one formation

**Even though solved the microadenoma, have to consider pt fertility, and possible diabetes**

# Short case 2

DDx:

-  Seizures => symptoms
-  Any infn can cause delerium

22y/o

-  Drugs
-  Seizure
-  Trauma
-  Infn

Ix:

-  CXR
-  Bloods: ABG (metabolic state, oxygen state), FBC, 

Causes of hyponatremia: 

-  Hypervolaemia: ecstasys => drinking lots of water
-  Euvolaemia: no oedema and jvp normal
-  Hypovolaemia

From low to high the pons will die, high to low the brain will blow (I think; dangers of replacing Na)
