2.  Osteosarcoma: most common in teenagers and children. Found femur, tibia, hip, shoulder.
3.  Ewings sarcoma: age between 5-20. Common locations are upper and lower leg, pelvis, upper arm, ribs.

# Path POW

## Arthritis

If the PIP extended and DIP flexed: swan neck deformity

| OA | RA | Both |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Minimal joint inflammation | Morning joint stiffness lasts >1 hour | Affects small joints of the hands |
| Joint pain worsens after use | Presence of extra-articular manifestations  | Visible nodules on hands |
| | Abnormal levels of autoantibodies  | | 
| | Mostly symmetrical polyarthritis affecting young females | |

Radiological

-  Both: loss of jt space, malalignment of joints
-  OA: subchondral cysts and sclerosis, formation of bony outgrowths at the end of joints

# Main case

# Short case 1

## Trigger 1

Ulcer: local defect of tissue or organ caused by sloughing of inflammatory or necrotic material.

Pathogenesis of ulcer formation: possibly from kicking the bed, then repetitive trauma. 

Factors preventing ulcer from healing (learn this):

-  Infn
-  Smoking
-  *Old* age
-  Heavy alcohol consumption
-  Medication: steroids, NSAIDs
-  Obesity
-  Repetitive trauma
-  Diabetic: due to decreased blood flow, increased risk for infn due to high sugar, neuropathy
-  Vascular disease (oxygen supply)
-  Poor hygiene + improper wound care
-  Malnutrition
-  Super rare genetic diseases

Wound present for long time: 

-  Can affect gait/joints
-  Osteomyelitis
-  Scar
-  Could turn malignant (if wound not healing, always biopsy it)
