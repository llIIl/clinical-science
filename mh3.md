# Main case

## Trigger 1

Psychosis: hallucinatiosn and delusion excluding organic causes without clouding of consciousness (important vs delirium)

Delusions: fixed false belief that is held even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary

-  Bizarre: impossible based on laws of physics
-  Non-bizarre: feasible

Hallucinations: perception without an external stimuli

# Short case 1

## Trigger 1

DDx:

-  MDD
-  BPD
-  Substance abuse

-  Organic causes

Ix:

-  Bloods
    -  FBC: check for anaemia
    -  TFT: thyroid dysfn can cause anxiety/lethargy, probably more common in older women
    -  Electrolytes: eating disorders + vomiting can lead to things such as kidney dysfn (dehydration/hypovolaemia), low Na can cause delirium, unlikely in this pt but good to rule out
    -  LFT
    -  Drug urine screen: seeing if these symptoms come secondary to drug use (emphasise this is about helping *them*, really need a very good reason to not ruin the therapeutic alliance)
    -  Vit B12 + folate: cause of anaemia
    -  Iron studies: causes of anaemia

Mx: fertile female => must assume baby in there when doing treatment
