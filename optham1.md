# Readings

# Main case

## Trigger 1

> 62M unilateral red eye at ED

DDx:

-  Conjunctivitis: more likely superficial scratchy pain, unilateral => bilateral
    -  Viral: often with URTI and their associated Sx
    -  Allergy: itchy, Hx of atopy
-  Intraocular: more likely gnawing pain
-  Shingles: have you had chicken pox, vaccinated? if vesicles at tip of nose (following shingles/herpes zoster) then it is likely that eye is infected
-  Glaucoma
-  Uveitis
-  Scleritis
-  Temporal arteritis = giant cell arteritis

## Trigger 2

Mechanism of photophobia:

## Trigger 3

Eye exam = includes node exam

Normal eye pressure is around 15mmHg

Right pupil smaller implies iritis

Chemosis = oedema of conjunctiva; epiphora = liquid trickling down

Consensual light response pain = right eye constricts but it is inflamed => pain

No RAPD = 2 (and 3?) is fine

Don't give local to home: incase it gets worse he can't tell, foreign bodies can enter without being known

Triage red eye for urgent referral to opthamologist: read GOLDEN EYE RULES

# Short case 1

Central artery/vein occlusion => extremely acute

Retinal detachment => stuff enters vitreous => floaters

Losing vision in centre of eye means that the macula is affected: red flag

# Short case 2

If eye is down and out it is CNIII palsy because LR abducting and SO depressing

If strabismus consider neuroblastoma

Rb1 mutation increases risk of osteosarcoma
